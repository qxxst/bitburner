I am aware that the scripts in this repository can be further optimized, so I encourage creating forks and pull requests for the purpose of doing so. Pull requests should meet the following requirements before being submitted:

- The name and/or description of the pull request make a reasonable effort to explain what it does.
- The script has been tested on your local machine. It is confirmed to be working and does not break the game or have any obvious problems.
- The script works in the newest "release" version of the game client (not a development branch).
- The script does not interfere with the effects of other scripts except when reasonably necessary, such as preventing the attempted use of a feature that is disabled in the current BitNode.
- The purpose(s) of the script can be reasonably determined by its naming convention, inline and/or block comments within the script, and/or respective changes to the markdown files in the `docs` folder that properly explain what the script does.

"Scripts" as used in this text refers to JavaScript files that have been added or changed in your pull request.

The use of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Google Bard, and GitHub Copilot are permitted, so long as the generated code has been reviewed by a human and all of the other requirements have been met:
> The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
