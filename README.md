# Bitburner
Netscript (JavaScript) files used in *Bitburner*. **Contains spoilers.**

Some of the scripts in this repository were made by me, and others were not. I have made a reasonable effort to provide attribution both in this repository and the scripts themselves. No copyright infringement is intended.

## Usage

Feel free to download these and use them in your own game, or create a pull request if you're looking to optimize them further. Do be aware though that some scripts rely on others in order to function properly. For example, `tix.js` won't work without `lib/helpers.js`.

Check out the [docs](https://github.com/qxxst/bitburner/tree/main/docs) folder for information on what each script does and how to properly use it.

Also, some scripts inherently require certain SourceFiles (if you know, you know) to be owned in order to function. The requirements (if any) for each script should be fairly obvious by its name and associated tasks, but will also be labeled in its respective entry in the documentation.
