# Bitburner
Netscript (JavaScript) files used in *Bitburner*.

Some of the scripts in this repository were made by me, and others were not. I have made a reasonable effort to provide attribution both in this repository and the scripts themselves. No copyright infringement is intended.

Feel free to download these and use them in your own game, or create a pull request if you're looking to optimize them further. Do be aware though that some scripts rely on others in order to function properly. For example, `tix.js` won't work without `lib/helpers.js`.
## Documentation
Check out the [docs](https://github.com/qxxst/bitburner/tree/main/docs) folder for information on what each script does and how to properly use it.
